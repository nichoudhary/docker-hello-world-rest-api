Number 20 - Step08 Using JIB Plugin to create docker image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The matter of fact is, the Dockerfile Maven Plugin in not the only plugin out there which can help you with building images for
your application. One of the popular options is something called JIB.

About JIB - mentioned in the readMe -> https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin#quickstart

JIB is a maven plugin for building Docker and OCI images for your java app. With JIB you don't need Dockerfile at all.

<plugin>
	<groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
	<artifactId>jib-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>1.6.1</version>
	<configuration>
		<container>
			<creationTime>USE_CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</creationTime>
		</container>
	</configuration>
	<executions>
		<execution>
			<phase>package</phase>
			<goals>
				<goal>dockerBuild</goal>
			</goals>
		</execution>
	</executions>
</plugin>

Now put the above plugin in pom.xml and delete the Dockerfile. Also comment out the maven dependency plugin.
run -> mvn clean package
And we can see that our image is created in the logs.
LOGS
--------
Built image to Docker daemon as 01-hello-world-rest-api:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
[INFO] Executing tasks:
[INFO] [==============================] 100.0% complete
-----------

run -> docker history 01-hello-world-rest-api:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
run -> docker run -p 8080:8080 01-hello-world-rest-api:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

Remember that Java specific and only java applications can be built from it. Also we can configure the base image and  a
lot of other things for that refer to readme -> after jib plugin part.
